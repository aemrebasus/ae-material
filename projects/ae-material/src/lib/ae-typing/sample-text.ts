export const sampleText = 'Highly Passionate and Self Motivated Full Stack Developer. Hi, I am a former computer science teacher and new Full Stack Developer. Although I have been learning software development for the last 10 years, my intention was to be a teacher because I love it. Learning, teaching, and sharing what I have has been one of the most satisfying activities and facts in my life. However, unfortunately, my dream turned out to a nightmare after 2 years of teaching career. I could not find the suitable ground to grow in the teaching career because my nerves are not that strong to bear random behaviors of lovely kids aging between 5 to 60. After losing my job, It took a while to find my passion and source of income. After a few months, I decided to start software development career because I have already known a lot about programming.I started from the basics. And I advanced almost every aspects of programming from planning, developing, designing , testing to staging, and development.I learned JAVA/JAVA EE/Spring Boot 5 because it is one of the most mature programming language and it is very easy to understand OOP concepts and Data structures with Java. Hopefully, after long lasting hard work, I got JAVA SE Certification. Then I learned NodeJS, JavaScript, and Typescript since almost all applications are running on the browsers. It did not take long to master JavaScript because I have developed several applications using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Adobe Flash at the University. My next stop was one of the master piece of Facebook, React Framework, because there are lots of opportunities in that field. After the long journey in the realm of React, I found myself in a bed with Angular Framework, thinking and dreaming about it. I loved it and mastered the every detail of it. After understanding the design and architecture of the Angular Framework, I went like Thanks God for creating good developers. After the long learning path, I developed an Angular Component library on top of Angular Material. It helps developers to build web applications faster. The library is for providing better and easy usage of Angular Material. It is a set of composite components like form builder, toolbar, messaging, list, image gallery etc. It supports an interface for each component so developers do not need to know about anything because it is very intuitive and supports autocompletion. Also each interface has a clear documentation.';
